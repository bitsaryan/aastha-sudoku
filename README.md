## Replace existing GitHub Pages build (keep the same link)
1. Open your existing repo on GitHub (where you deployed the earlier PWA).
2. Click **Add file â†’ Upload files** and drag-drop *all files* from this folder (including `icons/`), allowing GitHub to **replace** existing files.
3. Scroll down â†’ **Commit changes** to the `main` branch.
4. Wait for Pages to redeploy (usually under a minute). The existing URL stays the same.

> If the app still shows the old version on iPhone, itâ€™s the PWA cache. Either wait a bit (the service worker has been version-bumped), or long-press the home-screen icon â†’ **Delete App**, reopen the URL in Safari, and **Add to Home Screen** again.

## First-time publish (if needed)
Same as above, then **Settings â†’ Pages â†’ Source: Deploy from a branch** â†’ `main` / `/ (root)`.

## iPhone install
Open the URL in Safari â†’ **Share â†’ Add to Home Screen** â†’ launch from the icon.
